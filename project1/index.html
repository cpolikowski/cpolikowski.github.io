            <p>
                I am currently an undergraduate student studying Computer Science and minoring in Mathematics at <a href = "https://www.siena.edu/" style = "color:#006747">Siena College</a>. 
                Much of my programming experience is in Java and Python. This is my first experience experimenting with HTML and CSS and I am enjoying it so far! 
                 In my free time, I enjoy traveling and doing things with friends. Explore my page to see pictures I have taken over time.
